Plan for the Task

1️⃣ Basic API Interaction
# Use requests to interact with the FruityVice API.
# Accept user input for the fruit name.
# Fetch the details from the API

2️⃣ Extract Required Data
From the API response, extract and display:
✅ Full name
✅ ID number
✅ Family (biological classification)
✅ Sugar and carbohydrates (from nutritions)

3️⃣ Output Options
# Human-readable output: Nicely formatted for users.
# Machine-readable output: JSON format for programmactic use

4️⃣ Error Handling
# If the fruit does not exist, handle the error gracefully
# If the API is down, inform the user without crashing

5️⃣ Two Ways to Use the Code
# CLI Mode: Run via commanad line
# Library Mode: Import as a module for future use

6️⃣ Best Practices
# Follow clean code principles (functions, readabilty)
# Use logging instead of print() for debugging
# Add docstrings and comments for clarity
